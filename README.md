## Projects Overview

### Category C: Beginner Level
These introductory projects focus on fundamental Python skills, including basic scripting, simple GUIs, and straightforward web scraping.

#### 1. Timer
- **Description**: This project is a simple countdown timer that allows users to set a time duration and start a countdown. The application provides a visual representation of the remaining time and triggers an alert when the countdown finishes.
- **Technologies**: Python, PySide6, Qt

#### 2. Text to Speech
- **Description**: A basic application that converts text input into spoken words using the `pyttsx3` library. Users can enter any text, and the application will read it aloud, making it useful for accessibility or learning purposes.
- **Technologies**: Python, pyttsx3

#### 3. Autovit Web Scraper
- **Description**: This project involves scraping car listings from the Autovit website, a popular online marketplace for vehicles. The scraper extracts information such as car make, model, price, and location, and compiles it into a structured format for easy analysis.
- **Technologies**: Python, Scrapy

### Category B: Intermediate Level
These projects build on basic Python knowledge, incorporating more complex logic, GUI design, and web scraping techniques.

#### 1. Tic Tac Toe
- **Description**: A graphical Tic Tac Toe game that features both single-player and multiplayer modes. In single-player mode, the game includes an AI opponent with three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. The AI uses different algorithms to determine the best move, making the game challenging and engaging for users of all skill levels.
- **Technologies**: Python, PySide6, Qt

#### 2. Currency Converter
- **Description**: This application is a GUI-based currency converter that allows users to convert between different currencies. The app fetches real-time exchange rates from the official BNR (National Bank of Romania) website, ensuring that the conversions are accurate and up-to-date. Users can select the source and target currencies and input the amount to be converted.
- **Technologies**: Python, PySide6, Qt, Selenium

#### 3. Forbes Web Scraper
- **Description**: A web scraper that extracts data from the Forbes website, specifically targeting lists of top companies, billionaires, and other financial information. The scraped data is then formatted into a structured dataset that can be used for further analysis or reporting.
- **Technologies**: Python, Selenium

#### 4. Wikipedia Web Crawling
- **Description**: This project involves crawling Wikipedia to extract and structure information about a specific topic. The crawler navigates through various linked pages, collecting data and storing it in a format that can be easily queried and analyzed. This project demonstrates an understanding of recursive algorithms and large-scale data extraction.
- **Technologies**: Python, Scrapy

#### 5. Password Manager
- **Description**: A secure password manager application that allows users to store, retrieve, and manage their passwords. The application encrypts stored passwords using industry-standard cryptographic techniques, ensuring that sensitive information is kept secure. Users can add new passwords, update existing ones, and retrieve passwords as needed, all through a user-friendly interface.
- **Technologies**: Python, Json

### Category A: Advanced Level
These projects demonstrate advanced skills, such as integrating databases, building RESTful APIs, and implementing complex web scraping techniques.

#### 1. Wikipedia Country Web Scraper with MongoDB Database and Flask API
- **Description**: This project is an advanced web scraper that collects detailed information about countries from Wikipedia. The data includes population, area, GDP, and other key statistics. The scraped data is stored in a MongoDB database, which serves as the backend for a RESTful API built using Flask. The API allows users to query the database and retrieve country data in a structured format.
- **Technologies**: Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests, MongoDB, Flask
